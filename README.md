# Itztempy: A Detailed Overview

## Background

Itztempy, also known as Tempy, has been underaged for over two years, falsely claiming to be over 13 years old. Tempy has been a "developer" for over 3 months, with experience in coding for a lego blocks game (Roblox) and Python. However, Tempy's skills and understanding of coding concepts have been questioned.

## Skills

Tempy's skills include:

- Skidding
- Lying about income from a Roblox account generator
- Reading and understanding documentation (lie)
- Understanding of what a skid is (lie)
- Knowledge of GitHub tools (lie)
- Awareness of potential malware in open source projects on GitHub (lie)
- Use of developer tools, specifically the network tab (lie)

## Projects

Tempy's projects include:

- **Tempsploit**: A project that Tempy has reportedly given up on.
- **Tempgen**: A selenium-based Roblox account generator. Tempy claims it to be the best Roblox account generator.
- **TempCode**: A Roblox script project. It's reported that Tempy skidded this project from an open source project and another developer.
- **Other**: Tempy reportedly starts random projects and abandons them after a few weeks.

## Contact Information

Credits go to:

- [Pxsta](http://dsc.projectauto.xyz/): A luau Roblox Jailbreak cheat developer that gave Tempy most of the code to every project of his.
- [babyfayy333](https://discord.gg/hcxdapVphM): Another luau Roblox Jailbreak cheat developer that contributed to Tempy's projects.

## TempCode Leaked

Tempy's code to his current project [TempCode](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/tempservice/d0a3e82dfa1db85c00c4911c02e7f6ef/raw/66cd3860bdc10fbb6c4cdb10ef20dc1f07373c4c/gistfile1.txt) has been leaked. He will most likely delete that repository, making the hyper link useless. You can view the code for his script at `script.lua` file [here](./script.lua).
